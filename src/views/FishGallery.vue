      <v-card-title>Largemouth Bass</v-card-title>
      <v-card-text>
        The largemouth bass is olive in color. It will have a series of black
        blotches along it's side that will seem to form a jagged horizontal line
        the length of its body. Their upper jaw will extend behind the eye. This
        well help differentiate a largemouth from a spotted bass and other
        similar looking fish.

      <v-card-text>
        The smallmouth is easily distinguished from the largemouth by its
        clearly connected dorsal fins, the scales on the base portion of the
        soft-rayed second dorsal fin, and the upper jaw bone which extends only
        to about the middle of the eye. The coloration is also distinctive being
        usually more brownish in the smallmouth and more greenish in the
        largemouth.

      <v-card-text>
        Identifying characteristics of rock bass are their two dorsal fins that
        have spinous and soft-rayed united portions, a large mouth, six anal
        spines, red eyes; rows of dark dots on their sides. The mouth of a rock
        bass is located in the terminal position, below the snout, with small
        conical teeth to eat prey.

        The yellow perch is colored a green to yellow gold and has six to eight
        dark, broad vertical bars that extend from the back to below the lateral
        line, a whitish belly, and orange lower fins during breeding season. Its
        body is oblong and appears humpbacked; this is the result of the deepest
        part of the body beginning at the ﬁrst dorsal ﬁn, then tapering slightly
        to the beginning of the second dorsal ﬁn.
